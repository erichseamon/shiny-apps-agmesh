<h5><strong>Overview and Hypothesis</strong></h5>

<p style="text-align:justify">

This hypothesis proposes the development of a spatially explicit machine learning model to better understand the relationships of climate outcomes with agricultural commodity loss.  The USDA’s archive agricultural commodity loss (1980-present), with associates climate damage causes, will be used as a data source for our initial predictor, used as an estimate of agricultural climate impact. In term of a hypothesis statement, we can frame our statement as such:
