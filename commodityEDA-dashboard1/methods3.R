<p style="text-align:justify">Our initial exploratory analysis comparisons explore commodity loss in relationship to county and state.  In addition, we examine the cause of damage reported for claims by county and year, as well as claim distribution by month and year.

Insurance claims of agricultural commodity loss are quite spatially and temporally extensive.  The USDA summarizes claims at a county and monthly level, and provides data going back to 1980.</p>


                <p style="text-align:justify">This project is supported by NOAA thru the Climate Impacts Research Consortium, or CIRC (www.pnwcirc.org)</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Also, thanks to Matthew Leonawicz and the SNAP team in Alaska, for the initial base code and structure for these applications.</p>')
